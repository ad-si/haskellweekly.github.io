Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Jobs

-   [Galois is hiring for a variety of roles](https://galois.com/careers/) (ad)

    > Including but not limited to: Software Engineers/Researchers, Project Managers, Hardware Engineers, Red Team Lead, Software Integration Engineer.
    >
    > We collaborate with organizations like NASA, DARPA, and AWS to explore blue sky ideas and turn them into usable technology. Some of the things we've worked on in the past: Formal methods, static analysis, cryptographic algorithms, abstract interpretation, type theory, formal verification, reinforcement learning, autonomous systems assurance, communication security, cyber-deception for network defense, DDoS defense, provable hardware security, and statistical anomaly detection for detecting advanced persistent threats. We think working here is awesome; see [lifeatgalois.com](https://lifeatgalois.com).

-   [Mercury is hiring a Haskell engineer (Full-time/SF/US Remote)](https://mercury.co/jobs/generalist_engineer) (ad)

    > Mercury is a bank for businesses. Founded in 2017, Mercury is growing rapidly and is hiring an additional two full-time engineers. Join a small team writing a backend in 100% Haskell, using Nix for deployment, and using Typescript/React on the frontend.
