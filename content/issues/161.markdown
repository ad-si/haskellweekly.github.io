<!-- 2019-05-30 -->

Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Codata in action, or how to connect Functional Programming and Object Oriented Programming](https://www.javiercasas.com/articles/codata-in-action) by Javier Casas

    > I have been very interested in codata, mainly because it relates to data in a category-theory way, but, as usual, I didn't understand many of the words involved.

-   [Corydalis v0.4 released!](https://k1024.org/posts/2019/2019-05-26-corydalis-v0.4/) by Iustin Pop

    > Corydalis is a web-based image/video viewer to be used for local (non-cloud) image collections. Think of it as Geeqie but web-based and understanding your entire image collection.

-   [Cursors, Part 5: The Tree Cursor](https://cs-syd.eu/posts/2019-05-28-cursors-tree) by Tom Sydney Kerckhove

    > This is the fifth post in a series about cursors. It prepares the first data structure to write a simple forest editor

-   [Dimensions and Haskell: Introduction](https://serokell.io/blog/dimensions-and-haskell-introduction) by Danya Rogozin

    > We investigate features of functional programming in the context of machine learning. Python and R are the most widely used languages in this area. In this post, we discuss Haskell advantages in comparison to Python and R.

-   [Faking Fundeps with Typechecker Plugins](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/faking-fundeps/) by Sandy Maguire

    > Today I want to talk about another sort of GHC plugin: type-checker plugins! TC plugins let you hook into GHC's constraint machinery and help it solve domain-specific problems that it wouldn't be able to otherwise.

-   [Integrating Lua tests with `tasty-lua`](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/integrating-lua-tests-with-tasty-lua/703?u=taylorfausak) by Albert Krewinkel

    > I wrote a little utility, tasty-lua, to integrate Lua tests into tasty Haskell tests. It’s not much, but I liked how it turned out.

-   [Introducing Bipartite Graphs in Alga](https://summer.haskell.org/news/2019-05-29-alga-introduction.html) by Vasily Alferov

    > I am a student at Summer of Haskell this year and I am very thankful to authors of this site who provided me this platform to have a blog about GSoC. This is an introduction post about my project.

-   [On the arity of type families](https://ryanglscott.github.io/2019/05/26/on-the-arity-of-type-families/) by Ryan Scott

    > Alas, not everything can be partially applied. In particular, GHC offers a type families extension that lets you define functions for use at the type level.

-   [Ormolu: Format Haskell code like never before](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-05-27-ormolu.html) by Mark Karpov

    > If we think of the average Haskeller, who do we see? A poor, broken person. Tired head falls into the open palms, sobbing, deprived of the basic human right for automated source code formatting.

-   [The Next 700 Module Systems](https://alhassy.github.io/next-700-module-systems-proposal/) by Musa Al-hassy

    > A requirements driven approach to coherent modularisarion constructs in Dependently-typed languages.

## Jobs

<!-- keep through July 18 -->
-   [Galois is hiring for a variety of roles](https://galois.com/careers/) (ad)

    > Including but not limited to: Software Engineers/Researchers, Project Managers, Hardware Engineers, Red Team Lead, Software Integration Engineer.
    >
    > We collaborate with organizations like NASA, DARPA, and AWS to explore blue sky ideas and turn them into usable technology. Some of the things we've worked on in the past: Formal methods, static analysis, cryptographic algorithms, abstract interpretation, type theory, formal verification, reinforcement learning, autonomous systems assurance, communication security, cyber-deception for network defense, DDoS defense, provable hardware security, and statistical anomaly detection for detecting advanced persistent threats. We think working here is awesome; see [lifeatgalois.com](https://lifeatgalois.com).
