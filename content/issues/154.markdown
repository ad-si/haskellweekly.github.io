Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Become a Better Haskeller by Learning About Inductive Types](https://dimjasevic.net/marko/2019/04/08/become-a-better-haskeller-by-learning-about-inductive-types/) by Marko Dimjašević

    > While we usually and easily see the benefits of having a static type system on simple types such as integers, we might fail to see the benefits of applying the same principles to user-defined data types.

-   [The Rubik's Cube Group](https://jaredcorduan.github.io/posts/2019-04-10--rubik-group.html) by Jared Corduan

    > Permutations and symmetry are central themes of group theory, so it is perhaps not surprising that the Rubik's Cube has a nice algebraic description.

-   [A Type of Programming](https://atypeofprogramming.com) by Renzo Carbonara

    > Computers blindly follow orders, and at some fundamental level, programming is about giving computers orders to follow.

-   [Announcing Polysemy](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/polysemy/) by Sandy Maguire

    > I want to announce my new library `polysemy` --- it's higher-order, no-boilerplate, zero-cost free monads.

-   [Applicative Regular Expressions using the Free Alternative](https://blog.jle.im/entry/free-alternative-regexp.html) by Justin Le

    > Today, we're going to implement applicative regular expressions and parsers (in the style of the regex-applicative library) using free structures!

-   [Data Science in Haskell: An example using temperature data from Thailand and Myanmar](http://idontgetoutmuch.org/singleday.htm) by Dominic Steinitz

    > I have just returned from a cycling trip from Bangkok to Yangon. It was pretty hot.

-   [Finding Property Tests](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/contract-examples/) by Hillel Wayne

    > This was a pretty short dive into what makes a good property or contract. It also focused on just pure functions.

-   [GHC 8.8 Status](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20190405-ghc-8.8-status.html) by Ben Gamari

    > Needless to say, bringing this migration to a close ultimately required that we compromise on the 8.8.1 release schedule.

-   [ghcid for Web App Development](https://functor.tokyo/blog/2019-04-07-ghcid-for-web-app-dev) by Dennis Gosnell

    > One of the downsides of developing web applications in Haskell is the long recompilation cycle.

## Jobs

-   [Galois is Hiring!](https://workforcenow.adp.com/jobs/apply/posting.html?client=galois&ccId=19000101_000001&type=MP&lang=en_US) ([ad](https://haskellweekly.news/advertising.html))

    > Galois is looking for Software Engineers/Researchers and Project Managers! We collaborate with organizations like NASA, DARPA, and Amazon Web Services to explore blue sky ideas and turn them into usable technology. Some of the things we've worked on in the past: Formal methods, static analysis, binary analysis, cryptographic algorithms, domain specific languages, programming languages theory, abstract interpretation, type theory, formal verification and software correctness, reinforcement learning, autonomous systems assurance, communication security, cyber-deception for network defense, DDoS defense, provable hardware security, statistical anomaly detection for detecting advanced persistent threats. We think working here is awesome (see <https://lifeatgalois.com>).
