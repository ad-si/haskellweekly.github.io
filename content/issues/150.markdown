Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [How we made Haskell search strings as fast as Rust](https://tech.channable.com/posts/2019-03-13-how-we-made-haskell-search-strings-as-fast-as-rust.html) by  by Ruud van Asseldonk

    > In this post, we will describe our quest to create Alfred-Margaret, the fastest Haskell implementation of the Aho-Corasick string searching algorithm, which powers string search in Channable.

-   [An example of state-based testing in Haskell](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2019/03/11/an-example-of-state-based-testing-in-haskell/) by Mark Seemann

    > This article is an instalment in an article series about how to move from interaction-based testing to state-based testing.

-   [Bank kata in Haskell - using and testing date](https://codurance.com/2019/03/12/bank-kata-in-haskell-date/) by Liam Griffin-Jowett

    > Our final task to complete the kata is to add a date to the transactions. We will implement this in small logical steps, using the compiler and the tests to drive our design.

-   [Ceci n'est pas un default](https://gallais.github.io/blog/ceci-pas-default) by Guillaume Allais

    > Being the default value is not the same as being actively set to a value which happens to match the default. `Maybe` as a type constructor enriching an existing type with a default value is not satisfactory: what this default value means is not documented in the type.

-   [Code smell: Boolean blindness](https://runtimeverification.com/blog/code-smell-boolean-blindness/) by Thomas Tuegel

    > The popular term "boolean blindness" refers to the information lost by functions that operate on Bool when richer structures are available. Erasing such structure can give code a bad smell.

-   [Deriving not-so-complex types](https://blog.ramdoot.in/deriving-not-so-complex-types-ec5987f6d95c) by Arvind Devarajan

    > Often times, I get to read Haskell code with these patterns: `(fmap . fmap)`, `fmap (<*>)`, etc. I've just taken three of these types, and break these into their intuitions here in the hopes that somebody out there can understand when to use these.

-   [Enhancing File Durability in Your Programs](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/enhancing-file-durability-in-programs) by Roman Gonzalez

    > An unexpected shutdown (like a kernel panic, or unplugging the power cord) in a machine should not affect the durability of confirmed writes in programs we develop.

-   [Freer, yet Too Costly Higher-order Effects](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/freer-yet-too-costly/) by Sandy Maguire

    > As of today I have free, higher-order effects working. Unfortunately, they are not fast. I don't think this is a fundamental limitation, merely that whatever code I've written isn't amenable to GHC's optimization process.

-   [Modifying a Library!](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2019/2/7/modifying-a-library) by Monday Morning Haskell

    > We can see how to incorporate the change without stressing about its complexity. Even if you're only a beginner, this is a good skill to learn now!

-   [Types versus Tests: two approaches for writing correct software](https://www.stackbuilders.com/news/types-versus-tests-two-approaches-for-writing-correct-software) by Javier Casas

    > We try our best to have software without bugs. It's just a hard problem, and no silver bullet to slay this beast. All we have are several approaches at trying to kick the bugs out of the software.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [SBV](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sbv-8.1) (SMT Based Verification), a library that allows you to express properties about Haskell programs and automatically prove them using SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers.
